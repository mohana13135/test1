      <p>We hear a lot about Einstein's brain and its preservation in a strange museum called the Mather Museum in Philadelphia, but the point is that in addition to the brain, his eyes have also been locked away in New York for years. The eyes of this great scientist were stolen after his
       death and are now kept in a safe somewhere in this city. The owner of this bullr ing is a person named Henry Abrams, who was Einstein's ophthalmologist in 1939. In addition to Einstein,
        the body parts of important people such as George and Napoleon Bonaparte ar e also kept in New York.</p>
